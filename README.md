p-RoomMatch: Smart Roommate-Matching Platform

Project Overview

p-RoomMatch is a web-based platform designed to help first-year students find compatible roommates through an AI-driven, data-centric process. By leveraging clustering algorithms and a detailed questionnaire, the platform matches students based on their lifestyle preferences, living habits, and personal interests.

Key Features:

	•	Comprehensive questionnaire for lifestyle and preference analysis.
	•	AI algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to ensure optimal matches.
	•	Trial period for matched students to communicate and assess compatibility.
	•	Iterative matching for unmatched students, providing flexibility in roommate selection.

The platform aims to ease the transition into campus life, fostering early friendships and a more harmonious living environment for first-year students.

Project Member Requirements

Coding Portion:

	•	2-6 hours per week
	•	Skills required:
	•	Familiarity with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
	•	Experience with data science libraries like pandas and scikit-learn
	•	Knowledge of clustering techniques (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering)

Ethical Considerations

RoomMatch handles sensitive student data and must prioritize:

	•	Privacy and Confidentiality: Personal data is anonymized and securely stored with strict access controls.
	•	Bias-Free Algorithms: Ensure matching algorithms do not discriminate based on race, gender, or socio-economic status.
	•	Inclusivity: The platform is designed to be accessible to all students, regardless of technical skills or disabilities.
	•	Voluntary Participation: Ensure the platform remains optional, providing fair alternatives for students who choose not to use it.
